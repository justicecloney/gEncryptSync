# gEncryptSync
Scans for file changes, encrypts the file, then uploads to a google drive account

Watching every directory has been found to be impractical. Instead I will now scan subdirectories periodically to search for changes.

Currently working on :
Planning

Todo:
    
    set/change directory watched
    upload to google
    encrypt
    store keys
